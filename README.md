# Welcome! &#x1f44b;
A course geared towards master's students on getting started in economic research.

# Week 1: Topic $\supset$ Questions $\supset$ Paper
**Overview:** Many people are inspired to do economic research because they are interested in some broad topic. Topics are a great place to start your thinking, but a research paper will ultimately require a much
narrower focus. The focus of this week is:
1. Generating an idea
2. Thinking through an idea at the early stages
3. Laying the foundation and building a vision for the paper

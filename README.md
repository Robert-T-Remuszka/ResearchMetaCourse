A course geared towards master's students on getting started in economic research.

# Week 1: Finding and Communicating Ideas + Envisioning Papers
**Overview:** Many people are inspired to do economic research because they are interested in some broad topic. Topics are a great place to start your thinking, but a research paper will ultimately require a much more narrow focus. This week is about coming up with ideas, laying the groundwork for those ideas and ultimately building a clear vision for a paper.

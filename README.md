# Welcome! &#x1f44b;
A course geared towards master's students on getting started in economic research.

**Meeting Time:** Wednesdays, 11AM-12PM from June 4 to July 16, 2025. 

**Meeting Place:** Social Sciences 6116

**Office Hours:** By appointment (email me)

**Meeting Note:** I will be traveling the week of July 14, so our final meeting will be on Zoom!

**Submission Instructions** All assignments are due the 11:59PM (Madison time) on the Sunday following the Wednesday they are assigned. This will give me
time to read your submission and think about feedback that I think will be most helpful to your project.

# Week 1: Finding Ideas + Envisioning Papers &#x1F9D0;
**Overview:** Many people are inspired to do economic research because they are interested in some broad topic. Topics are a great place to start your thinking, but a research paper will ultimately require a narrower focus. This week is about coming up with ideas, laying the groundwork for those ideas and ultimately building a clear vision for a paper.

**Required Reading:** [Varian](/lit/VarianHowTo.pdf), [Angrist and Pischke Chapter 1](/lit/AngristPischkeC01.pdf)

**Additional Reading:** [Bellemare Chapter 2](../BellemareC02.pdf)

# Week 2: The Tools + Presenting &#x1F527;
**Overview:** This week I will walk through some tips on how to use LaTex to create an effective presentation. This is where you show people how you are thinking about the question you are interested in. I will also show you my broader workflow. I will also emphasize the iterative nature of building presentations. Writing is thinking and creating slide decks is a particularly important version of "writing" since it requires you to be concise.

**Assignment I:** Create a slide deck with only two slides. The first slide should be the title slide. The second slide is an introduction slide that includes both your motivation and question(s) of interest. Remember to be as concise *as possible*. Feel free to include the presentation notes in your submission.

**Tips for Assignment I:** Being concise is hard because it requires clarity in your thinking. Achieving clarity takes time. An effective way to build clarity and a strong foundation for your project is to start on a simple model early. Follow the steps in [Varian](/lit/VarianHowTo.pdf) and come to office hours if you get stuck.

# Week 3: Student Presentations I &#x1f4c5;
**Overview:** This week you will present what you submitted for assignment 1.

**Assignment II:** Write a simple model which illustrates the economics of your question. If you followed the tip for assignment I, then you should have at least begun thinking about this process. If your question is primarily empirical, then the model is likely already written. In that case, you would present the "canonical" model to the class. Write the theory section of the slide deck that you submitted for assignment 1. I expect that you will get stuck here. If you do, please email me so that we can set up an office hour! Submit the slide deck with the new theory section appended.

After you submit, start thinking about the following questions:
- Does your model make a clear prediction about what should happen when parameters change (comparative statics)?
- What does your model tell us about how the data should be interpreted?
- What is the ideal experiment that you would use to test your theory?

# Week 4: How to Write a Proposal + Example &#x1f4c5;
**Overview:** Proposals are important for getting your research funded. At this point you have presented once. You should be thinking of a simple model or framework that can help people understand the economics of what your question. This model should also suggest how you might approach the data. At this stage, writing a proposal will help you even if you do not ultimately win because it will help you plan the way you will address your question. We will see an example this week of how you can organize your thoughts and write a competitive proposal.

**Required Reading:** [CBO Call for Research](lit/CBO_Call.pdf), [An Example from my Own Work](lit/Example_Proposal.pdf)

**Useful Reading:** [Bellemare Chapter 5](lit/BellemareC05.pdf)

# Week 5: Statistical Software &#x1f4c5;
**Overview:** Economists program a lot. We can broadly categorize the kinds of programming economists do into "statistical" and "numerical" programming. Of course, these two kinds of programming overlap. This week we will focus on statistical programming using Stata. I will give examples
of how to 
- Organize the folders a research project
- Best practices to ensure reproducibility
- Read data into Stata
- Merge datasets
- Create graphs
- Run regressions
- Create regression tables

**Remark** The file [exec.do](/code/exec.do) runs all the code I will use in this week's lecture.
